# Does my BLE device support ‘Classic Bluetooth’ besides BLE?

Yes, the communications chipset on the Nano 33 BLE can be both a BLE and Bluetooth® client and host device. Something pretty unique in the world of microcontroller platforms.

But what is the difference between them? Well, BLE is optimized for **low power** use at **low data** rates, and was designed to operate from simple lithium coin cell batteries.

If you want to see how easy it is to create a Bluetooth® central or a peripheral device, explore the examples at our [ArduinoBLE library](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoBLE).
