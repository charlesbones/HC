# How can I recover my password or username?

Losing your password or forgetting your username are common situations but are also easy to solve. In the following instruction we will guide you on how to recover the password or your username in case you have used an Arduino username to log in before.

In case you have used the Sign in with Google option, you need to get in contact directly with Google.

Ok, let’s begin. First, go to [https://auth.arduino.cc/](https://auth.arduino.cc/)  and click on “Forgot your username/password?”
