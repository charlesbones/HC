# What is the difference between the Create plan and the Chrome App subscription?

These two Arduino products are often mistaken and cause confusion among the community. Below we will define both online services separately and explain their differences:

[Arduino Create](https://create.arduino.cc/) is an integrated platform that enables Makers and Professional Developers to configure boards, code online, save sketches on cloud and create connected objects in an easy way. This platform is available online and can be accessed by any user from almost any device with internet connection and a compatible browser. 

Arduino IoT Cloud, Web Editor, and Device Manager are part of the platform, which also has links to other services such as Getting Started pages, Digital Store and Project Hub.

Arduino Create has different types of plans: FREE, MAKER and PRO subscription. The free plan does not involve any fees and any user with an Arduino account can login and make use of it. The free plan can be upgraded to Maker or Pro paid scriptions plans. They extend the capabilities of the system and provide some additional features.

[Arduino Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arduino-create/dcgicpihgkmccjigalccipmjlnjopdfe) is a Chrome extension required to connect an Arduino board to a Chromebook device. The Chrome App extension also allows you to code online, save your sketches in the cloud, and upload them to any Arduino board connected to your Chromebook. If you have a Chromebook and want to know more about the Arduino Chrome App [click here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arduino-create/dcgicpihgkmccjigalccipmjlnjopdfe) and try it free for 30 days.

The Chrome App subscription is available for individual users but special plans for schools and classrooms are also available. If you are an educator or part of a school or organization and need to activate the Arduino Chrome App on several Chromebooks you can find out more information about all different plans available here: [Arduino Chrome App Subscription for Education](https://create.arduino.cc/plans/chrome-app).
