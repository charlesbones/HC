# Can’t install Chromeapp, the “Try Now” or “Buy Now” buttons are grayed out and disabled

## If you are in Brazil

There Chrome Web store from Brazil has a problem that does not allow to install this app. Please use instead the [US Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arduino-create/dcgicpihgkmccjigalccipmjlnjopdfe?gl=US) link (which has the same subscription cost).

## If you are using a Google Apps for Education (GAFE) Google ID

The Chrome Web Store doesn’t allow GAFE users to install paid apps even if they have a free trial. IT administrators and/or teachers should sign-up for a plan [here:](https://create.arduino.cc/plans/chrome-app).

After you are signed up for the plan, you will received instructions on how to install an education specific version of the Arduino Create Chrome app, a tutorial that explains all this is available here.
