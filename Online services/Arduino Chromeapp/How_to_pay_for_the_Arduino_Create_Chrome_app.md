# How to pay for the Arduino Create Chrome app

Arduino create Chromebook service partitions into two segments i.e for the single user or under the school education plan.

## User type
1. For a **single user**: you can pay via chrome web store using this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arduino-create/dcgicpihgkmccjigalccipmjlnjopdfe). The chrome web store app for Arduino is free for 30 days and the monthly payment for using the chrome app subscription is 0.99 USD.

2. For the **school education plan**: The subscription plans for the Arduino Create chrome app are divided into 3 main different categories based on the number of seats. So the price of the seat goes down if you buy more seats.  Please make sure that the email for purchasing the subscriptions for the education plan must be a google account.
   Take into account that you can create multiple groups or classrooms within the same subscription. Suppose, you bought 300 seats, then you can create 3 classrooms for 5th grade, 6th grade and 7th-grade students.  

   Please have a look at this link of our [Digital Store page](https://create.arduino.cc/plans/chrome-app) on the official Arduino [website](https://www.arduino.cc/) where you will be able to see the pricing of each seat based on the size of your classroom.

## Payment options

### Credit Card
You can use your Credit Card for paying the monthly subscription. The Card details will be saved so the subscription amount will be deducted every month on the billing date.

The billing date is the date you purchased the plan. In case, you want to add more seats you donâ€™t have to enter the card details again.

### ACH Wire transfer (Only for US customers)
The ACH wire transfer option is available only to US customers with US bank account that is part of the ACH system. You will be asked for how many months you would like to subscribe, being 1 month the minimum value. This month duration can be changed later.
