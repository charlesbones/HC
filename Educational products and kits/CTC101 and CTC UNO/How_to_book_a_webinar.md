# How to book a webinar

If you are a teacher who is running CTC101, you also have access to support webinars by our Arduino Experts. The first webinar to participate in is the *How to get started-webinar*. To book this webinar, navigate to *Training* in the sidebar to the right.

You will receive a confirmation email after the booking is completed.

If you have a **CTC 101 Full program**, you will have access to a training webinar for each module. In these online training sessions, an Arduino Education expert will answer questions and give you advice about the content of each module and its implementation in the classroom.

To book a module webinar, navigate to *Educators* in the menu to the right.
