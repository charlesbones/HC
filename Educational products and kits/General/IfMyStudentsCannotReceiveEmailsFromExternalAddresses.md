# If my students cannot receive emails from external addresses

In order for the students to be enrolled in the online platform, they have to click an invitation link that is usually sent to their email address. If your educational institution does not allow your students to receive emails from external addresses you can still enroll them using this method instead.

In Science Kit, CTC GO! and Engineering Kit: from the top menu, navigate to DASHBOARD or CLASS MANAGEMENT.

Now you will be redirected to a page containing all the invitation links that you can provide your students with. Note that the links in this image do not work.

After the students follow the links, they will be redirected to a page that asks them to create a new account. Follow the instructions on this page and they will have access to the platform.

Keep in mind that this method prevents the students to recover their accounts if they lose their password. This means that they will need to create a new Arduino account linked to a new email address in order for you to invite them platform again; however, the previous account will remain active and occupying a seat on the student list. This means that if you have already filled all student seats, you won't be able to re-invite the student that lost their account.
